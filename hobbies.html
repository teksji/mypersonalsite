      <h3>Things I want to do...</h3>
      <ol>
          <strong><li>Games</li></strong>
          <p>I use Teksji as my screen name, since it has never been used before and I like that as a sign of my individuality.</p>
          <p>Although I am not as knowledgeable as other gamers when it comes to terminologies, I just happen to enjoy playing games such as</p>
          <h4>Genshin Impact</h4>
          <img src="images/genshin.png" width=50% alt="genshin-impact">
          <p>Look at that, Kazuha supporting Bennett! I came for the gameplay, I stayed for the lore and cinematography. Gacha games are not</p>
          <p>really my thing, but good thing that they balanced the elements well such as partnering gacha with a plot, events and the fact that.</p>
          <p>it is a free-to-play game. I'm a mobile phone player wishing to upgrade my PC specs very soon >< </p>
          <h4>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</h4>
          <img src="images/mlbb.png" width="50%" alt="mobile-legends">
          <p>I started playing two years after its release and my skills aged pretty well. I quite lack the determination to push to mythical glory,</p>
          <p>even when others keep telling me that I should because I could. Pretty crazy how I went from support role to carry role. I still can</p>
          <p>do support when necessary. Plus, <em>that made me calmer despite its players having stress issues</em> haha</p>
          <h4>League of Legends: Teamfight Tactics</h4>
          <img src="images/tft.png" width="50%" alt="teamfight-tactics">
          <p>I'm fairly new to this game and I have yet to be fully familiar with the mechanics. I'm quite doing well while following the meta.</p>
          <p>And I experience being <strong>the last commander standing in the carousel!</strong></p>
          <h4>And others...</h4>
          <p>I also played the League of Legends itself, Minecraft, Rise of Kingdoms, Albion Empire, etc. And I learned so much about the games</p>
          <p>and its community. There's still a lot of games I'd like to play, but it still depends on my device.</p>
          <strong><li>Writing</li></strong>
          <p>I like different kinds of writing, especially poetry and narratives! Sometimes poetry can be songs too, and I used to write songs</p>
          <p>for anyone special to me. I quite lack the creativity because I write about things that make sense.</p>
          <strong><li>Music</li></strong>
          <p>There it goes for singing, dancing, and playing instruments. These are some of the skills that I've learned along the way and even</p>
          <p>if I don't do these now because I don't have time and resources for it, whenever I do I still ace it heh</p>
          <strong><li>Drawing and design</li></strong>
          <p>This is also one of the things that I can already do well and relearn over and over, whether it was a traditional art, digital art, or even photoshop (I edited my profile icon lol) and video editing.</p>
          <p> This was my first skill or talent, and I learned it when I was around 5.</p>
          <img src="images/website1.png" width="75%" alt="website-design-figma">
          <p>Here I used figma to speedrun a sample website layout for our project proposals in Microservices Architecture </p>
          <img src="images/htmlcsswebsite.png" width="75%" alt="website-design-html">
          <p>This is HTML5 website I made for the scraping project last semester hehe (yes I also made and named the logo Retreeve)</p>
          <img src="images/quarx.png" width="25%" alt="quarx-logo">
          <p>Our logo I made for this semester's duo group Quarx in Microservices. Trust me there's a lot of meaning to it haha</p>
          <img src="images/figmamobile1.png" width="50%" alt="figma-phone-1">
          <img src="images/2figmamobile.png" width="50%" alt="figma-phone-2">
          <img src="images/figmamobile3.png" width="50%" alt="figma-phone-3">
          <p>This one was my Figma design for smart healthcare monitoring mobile app for the Big Data project last semester.</p>
          <p><em>(I have to put these in my portfolio lolll)</em></p>
          <strong><li>Watching movies</li></strong>
          <p>I was quite a late bloomer because I couldn't afford going to a cinema or having a cable. But now that I do, it feels good to catch up.</p>
          <strong><li>Learning</li></strong>
          <p>It's pretty obvious because I know a lot of things, and I do love learning to all extent. Even if it means doing a mistake to learn from it.</p>
          <strong><li>Reaching happiness</li></strong>
          <p>I want to bring this up because, although I don't intend to promote toxic positivity, after all the years of being broken and not really enjoying every success </p>
          <p>I've reached due to my serious mental condition and unlucky events, I am finally managing to be the happiest person I've ever been,</p>
          <p>and I want to live further instead of otherwise to hopefully share that happiness with others.</p>
      </ol>
